Special thanks to ManicQuinn for their hard work on the [Gremlin Tracker](https://github.com/ManicQuinn/SlimeVR-Gremlin). My case design uses a lot of their sizing for 3D printing on the inside. 

The style of Ibis Trackers is based on a philosophy that they should be strong, reliable, simple, and easy to make. The exterior is heavily inspired by [Cheesecakes](https://github.com/Sorakage033/SlimeVR-CheeseCake) by Sorakage033. 

Thanks to everyone who purchased my trackers, and everyone who helped me along the way!
